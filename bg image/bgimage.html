        <p class="p1">This article aims to describe the students' ability in writing a paragraph. It is a descriptive qualitative in which the number of respondents is 60 students. All samples are taken from the guided writing class as the first subject series of a writing class. The data collection is obtained through a number of assignments they did and uploaded in a blog. From all assignments of writing task, only six assignments of writing task were taken and analyzed, based on top ones in writing quality starting from topic sentence, supporting sentences, and concluding sentence. Based on the analysis result, students ability is located on weakness in determining the topic sentence, starting the topic sentence, and writing supporting sentences. Their weakness appears because of the inability to formulate the topic, topic sentence, and difficulty to find the relevant supporting sentences to write for supporting the topic sentence. The inability of formulating topic, topic sentence, and supporting sentences contributes towards inability to apply the unity knowledge in making supporting sentences unitedThe  basic  skill  the  learners  should  have  in  writing  is  the  ability  to  know,  to understand,  and  to  formulate  the idea  or issue  to write  into  a  topic.  This  basic ability determines  the students'  success in  the  next step  for writing  process. The ability  to  understand  and  catch  the  issue  will  open  the  students'  perspective dealing  with  what  to discuss  and  elaborate  in  detail.  This  step takes  learners  to move  forward  to  be  able  to  arrange  their  issues  gotten  so  that  it helps  them  in starting to  write.  The  reason  why it  is  basic is  that all  learners  are  trained  to be able to read and think critically towards text as the source of reading. Formulating the  idea  or  issue  to  write  into  the  topic  will  occur  because  learners  have  the concept of  knowledge.  It happens  because of  the  ability to  understand  and  have the  issue.  Having  basic  skill in  determining the  topic and  topic sentence  is the must for all learners for those who have a high focus on writing.</p>
